# Software delivery process

## Purpose

This file documents how work flows from ticket to merged PR in this repository. The agent skills configured in `.ai/agentic.config.json` enforce the process; humans read it here. PRs target `{{baseBranch}}`; issues and PRs live in {{tracker}}, with every tracker operation the skills run defined in `.ai/trackers/{{tracker}}.md` (edit that file to extend or override tracker behavior).

Work enters through two paths: a free-form task brief handed to an agent, or a filed ticket. Both converge on the same review loop, the same validation gate, and the same merge gates.

## Roles

- **Author** — the human or agent who writes the change. Owns the ticket from claim to a merge-ready PR.
- **Reviewer** — reads the diff and approves or requests changes. May be a human or the `om-auto-review-pr` skill; the `om-code-review` checklist applies either way.
<!-- IF qaGate -->
- **QA reviewer** — manually exercises user-facing changes before they merge. Always referenced by role, never by name or handle: assignments change.
<!-- END IF -->
- **Maintainer** — owns branch protection, the label taxonomy, the config, and this document; arbitrates when gates conflict.

## Ticket lifecycle

| Stage | What happens | Driven by | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intake | A ticket or task brief is filed in {{tracker}} with enough detail to act on. | Anyone | Ticket exists |
| Triage | Confirm the issue is real, still unfixed on `{{baseBranch}}`, and not already claimed or covered by an open PR. Read-only; stops the chain cleanly when there is nothing to do. | `om-verify-in-repo` or a human | Confirmed actionable, or closed as no-action |
| Claim | The author claims the ticket so concurrent agents back off. See the claim protocol below. | `om-fix` / `om-auto-create-pr`, or a human | Claim visible on the ticket |
| Implement | Locate the minimal change surface (`om-root-cause`, read-only), then implement the change with regression tests and run the validation gate. Task briefs without a ticket go through `om-auto-create-pr`, which plans, implements phase by phase in an isolated worktree, and runs the same gate. | `om-root-cause` + `om-fix`, `om-auto-create-pr`, or a human author | Change complete, validation gate green |
| PR | Commit, push, and open a PR against `{{baseBranch}}` with normalized labels. On a hand-worked branch, `om-check-and-commit` runs the gate, fixes obvious drift, and pushes when green. | `om-open-pr`, `om-auto-create-pr`, or `om-check-and-commit` | Open, labeled PR |
| Review loop | The reviewer reads the diff against the `om-code-review` checklist and approves or requests changes. Requested changes are addressed (`om-auto-continue-pr` resumes agent PRs from the tracking plan, and adopts a PR that has none by reconstructing the plan from the PR's own context) and the PR is re-reviewed until approved. | `om-auto-review-pr` (single PR), `om-review-prs` (sweep), or a human | Approving review submitted |
<!-- IF qaGate -->
| QA | A PR carrying `needs-qa` waits for manual QA. A QA reviewer tests it and records the outcome. See the QA gate below. | QA reviewer (manual) | `qa-approved` applied, or `qa-failed` routes it back |
<!-- END IF -->
| Merge | `om-merge-buddy` reports, read-only, which PRs can merge now and which are close but blocked. `om-approve-merge-pr` re-checks every gate, approves, and squash-merges. | `om-merge-buddy` + `om-approve-merge-pr`, or a human | PR squash-merged into `{{baseBranch}}` |
| Post-merge housekeeping | Close issues the merged PR fixes; comment on issues whose PRs were closed without merging; turn leftover asks or review comments into tracked follow-up issues. | `om-close-fixed-issues`, `om-followup-issue-from-pr` | Tracker reconciled, follow-ups filed |

## Label state machine

Pipeline labels are mutually exclusive: a PR carries at most one, and it names where the PR sits in the flow.

- A ready, non-draft PR carries `review`.
- The reviewer moves it: request changes → `changes-requested`; after fixes it returns to `review`; approval → `merge-queue`.
- `merge-queue` is routing, not proof of QA: a `needs-qa` PR legitimately sits there until QA signs off.
- Only a QA reviewer sets the `qa` pipeline label. They move a queued `needs-qa` PR from `merge-queue` to `qa` while testing, then back to `merge-queue` with `qa-approved` on pass, or to `qa-failed` on failure. Automated skills request QA with `needs-qa`; they never set `qa`.
- `blocked` and `do-not-merge` are set and cleared by humans and stop the flow wherever it is.

| Group | Labels | Exclusivity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pipeline | `review`, `changes-requested`, `qa`, `qa-failed`, `merge-queue`, `blocked`, `do-not-merge` | one at a time | Workflow state |
| Category | `bug`, `feature`, `refactor`, `security`, `dependencies`, `documentation` | additive | Kind of change |
| Meta | `needs-qa`, `skip-qa`, `qa-approved`, `qa-self-verified`, `in-progress`, `ci-monitoring` | additive | Process signals |
| Priority | `priority-low`, `priority-medium`, `priority-high`, `priority-extreme` | one at a time; unset = medium | Urgency of the work |
| Risk | `risk-low`, `risk-medium`, `risk-high` | one at a time; unset = medium | Blast radius of the change |

Priority is how urgent the work is; risk is how dangerous the change is to ship. A one-line fix for an outage can be `priority-extreme` and `risk-low`; a large auth refactor that can wait can be `priority-low` and `risk-high`. A PR inherits both from its source issue unless the scope clearly changed. When an automated skill adds or changes a pipeline or meta label, it leaves a short comment explaining why.

When no priority label is set, infer one:

- `priority-extreme` — production outage, data loss, or an active security incident.
- `priority-high` — security hardening or a release-blocking regression.
- `priority-medium` — ordinary bug fixes and net-new features (also the default reading of unset).
- `priority-low` — cosmetic, docs-only, dependency bumps, follow-up cleanup.

When no risk label is set, infer one:

- `risk-high` — auth, sessions, data scoping, money, schema migrations, shared contract surfaces, or broad cross-cutting edits.
- `risk-medium` — an ordinary single-area change that ships with tests (also the default reading of unset).
- `risk-low` — docs-only, test-only, typo, or isolated cosmetic changes.

When signals conflict, pick the higher label and say why in the label comment. A `risk-high` PR strengthens the case for `needs-qa` and deeper review even when it would otherwise look routine.

One label lives outside this taxonomy: `do-not-close`, applied by humans to issues that housekeeping skills must never auto-close. Skills only ever read it.

<!-- IF qaGate -->
## The QA gate

The one hard rule of this process: **a PR carrying `needs-qa` must not merge until it also carries `qa-approved`, even when every other check is green.** `om-merge-buddy` classifies such a PR as blocked; `om-approve-merge-pr` refuses to merge it.

- Apply `needs-qa` to UI changes, new features, and other user-facing behavior that needs manual exercise.
- `skip-qa` is the explicit opt-out for docs-only, dependency-only, CI-only, test-only, and similarly low-risk non-user-facing changes. Never combine it with `needs-qa`.
- `qa-failed`, `do-not-merge`, and `blocked` are hard blocks regardless of every other signal. An active `qa` pipeline label means a tester is on the PR right now — never merge under an active tester.
- The gate is satisfied when a QA reviewer tests the PR and applies `qa-approved`.
- **Self-QA exception**: when no QA reviewer has capacity in time, any engineer may sign off instead — but only by (1) checking the PR out and running it locally, (2) exercising the affected flow, and (3) attaching evidence to the PR: a screenshot of it working, or a written account of what was exercised and the observed result. Then apply both `qa-approved` (so the gate passes) and `qa-self-verified` (so the exception is auditable). No evidence, no `qa-approved`.
<!-- END IF -->

## The claim protocol

Before mutating an issue or PR, an agent claims it with all three signals: it assigns itself, adds the `in-progress` label, and posts a claim comment saying what it is doing. Any agent that finds an existing claim backs off instead of colliding. A PR carrying `in-progress` is also skipped by the merge tooling.

`in-progress` means **actively working**. Once an agent's work is finished and fully reported — labels applied, review submitted, comments posted — it swaps `in-progress` for `ci-monitoring` if it still intends to report the CI outcome. `ci-monitoring` is **not** a claim and blocks nobody: it says only that the CI-result follow-up comment is still owed, so another agent or a human may act on the PR freely. That distinction matters because CI runs long: an agent that reported its work and then died while watching a run leaves an honest, self-describing state instead of a lock nobody holds. The label comes off when the follow-up lands, or when the agent gives up waiting at `ci.maxWaitMinutes` and says so.

The claim is released when the work finishes — on success and on failure alike. A stale `in-progress` with no recent activity may be cleared by the maintainer.

### Reporting is decoupled from CI

Agents apply labels, submit reviews, and post comments **as soon as their work is done**, without waiting for CI to go green. A review submitted while checks are still running says so in its body: branch protection plus the QA-approval gate hold the actual merge, and the approval covers the code, not a green run. The CI outcome arrives afterwards as a follow-up comment, which also corrects the pipeline label if the result changes the verdict.

The wait for that outcome is bounded by `ci.maxWaitMinutes` (default 40). When it expires with checks still running, the agent stops waiting, runs the local validation gate as its own evidence, posts that together with the still-pending check names and an explicit statement that no further follow-up is coming, drops `ci-monitoring`, and finishes.

A red signal does not short-circuit the review either. A failing required check or a conflicted head is collected as a **blocker finding** and reported together with the full code review, never instead of it: one review cycle gives the author the failing check, the conflict, and every code finding at once, rather than the cheapest red flag first and another cycle to discover the rest. Such a verdict is still `changes-requested` — completeness changed, the gate did not.

None of this touches the merge gates. Reporting early is safe; merging early is not — required checks still gate every merge, and the merge tooling refuses until they are genuinely green.


## The automation contract

The `om-auto-*` skills run this process unattended and are chainable: each accepts the artifact the previous one produced (an issue id, a spec path, or a PR number from the `PR: #<number> (link: <url>)` reference line every PR-producing skill emits), and each detects work already started — an open PR referencing the issue or plan — and continues on it rather than opening a duplicate. A completed autonomous run leaves a **ready** (non-draft), fully labeled PR — one pipeline label, category, QA meta, one priority, one risk — with a run-summary comment and, for user-facing changes, screenshots from the working app attached as PR evidence. Draft PRs are reserved for explicitly incomplete states: spec-only design PRs, interrupted hand-offs, or autonomous defaults flagged for human confirmation. Automation never applies `qa-approved`.

## Validation gate

Every PR passes the full validation gate before review sign-off, in this order:

{{validationCommands}}

Any non-zero exit fails the gate and blocks the PR. The implementing skills run the gate before opening a PR, and `om-check-and-commit` runs it before pushing a hand-worked branch. The command list lives in `.ai/agentic.config.json`; when it changes, update it there and in this section together.

## Amending this process

This document and `.ai/agentic.config.json` describe the same process: change them together, and re-run the `om-setup-agent-pipeline` skill when the toolchain or label taxonomy changes. Per-skill deviations — extra review rules, a different PR body template, an added gate step — belong in a repo-local skill of the same name at `.ai/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, which takes precedence over the installed skill (and can `@`-import or reference it to extend rather than replace it); local rules win, but a repo-local skill cannot grant what the installed skill's safety rules forbid.
